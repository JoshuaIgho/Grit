export const manifestoText = `I build systems.
I break limits.
I don't chase noise — I chase precision.

Every line of code, every breath — a test of focus.

No distractions. No shortcuts. No excuses.
Just the work. Just the grind. Just the grit.

I am a full-stack developer.
But more than that — I am disciplined.
I am relentless.
I am focused on mastery.`;
